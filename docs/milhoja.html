<span id="chp-milhoja"></span><h1>Milhoja<a class="headerlink" href="#milhoja" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>Milhoja is a domain specific runtime design to execute a graph given
to it over and over again. The motivation comes from the kind of
applications that have an evolution cycle where the control flow does
not vary from one timestep to another, but might vary from one
application instance to another. Thus all the analysis for optimizing
the graph is done offline. Milhoja does not concern itself with
concepts such as work stealing, or reapportioning work dynamically. In
that sense it an execution engine that makes the data and the
computation move as dictated by user’s recipe translated by CG-Kit
into a graph.</p>
<section id="milhoja-design-features">
<span id="sec-mdesign"></span><h2>Milhoja Design Features<a class="headerlink" href="#milhoja-design-features" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The design goal of Milhoja is to develop a base set of runtime
elements, such as thread teams, that can be composed at runtime into
<strong>thread team configurations</strong> in ways that maximize the efficient use
of the node. For a given simulation, Milhoja operates with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(N\)</span>
thread teams that are created when the simulation starts and persist
until the simulation terminates, where each team is allowed to
simultaneously use at most <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(M\)</span> threads at any given time. The
thread teams are run in cycles such that for each cycle a team is
assigned an action routine and a data model. Examples of data model are
tiles, blocks, and data packets of blocks. Upon starting a cycle, the
team is given the data and the threads of the
team work in a coordinated fashion so that the given action is applied
to each data item once. The cycle ends once the team has been informed
that no more data items will be given and the action has been applied to
all given data items. In our design, the pairing of the action with data
items is viewed as a task so that thread teams implement task-based
parallelism <em>via</em> thread-level parallelism. While the threads in the
team execute code in the host, they can also be used to launch kernels
in accelerators and therefore make use of finer-grained parallelism.
Ideally, the data type assigned to a thread team for a given action will
be chosen based on the hardware that the action routine has been written
to use. For instance, a tile would be a sensible data type for executing
an action routine that uses the CPU for heavy computation or a data
packet of blocks for a routine that launches kernels on a remote device
with its own memory system.</p>
<p>Note that no part of this design limits itself to using manually built
task graphs nor requires extreme simplicity in them. The interfaces are
designed to be robust enough that Milhoja can also execute complex
task graphs. By ddisassociating the executor of the graph from the
generator, we have ensured that in the future, we will be able to use
automation in task graph generation without having to alter the
mechanics of the Milhoja. All the heavy lifting of analysis and
scheduling can be done separately in the generator which never needs to
interface with the executor. We believe that this model of combination
of program synthesis with orthogonal composition concepts will have
longevity because of its ability to adapt to new systems incrementally.</p>
<p>Milhoja relies upon helper code generation tools to perform its
work. Given that the task definition can vary from one application
instance from another even when the underlying physics is unvarying,
clearly the data and computation that needs to move between devices is
not known apriori. That information is generated by CG-Kit. Therefore
we need code generators that can create data packets and tasks to be
digested by Milhoja based upon the recipe that is ingested by
CG-Kit. Note that if there is no division of work between devices in
the recipes CG-Kit, Milhoja need not be used in the application at
all, and CG-Kit is able to generate all the needed code. However, if
Milhoja is to be used, then these additional code generators come
into play.</p>
<p>The code generator for assembling data packets relies upon
annotations in the interfaces of the unit API. In Flash-X every unit
has a file that specifies all of the unit’s public interfaces. We
include comments in the interface file that describe all of the
information needed by the code generators for data packets and
tasks. An example of these annotations is given below</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>insert the comment section of hydro</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the annotations start by defining data and arguments that
are common to more than one interface to avoid having to replicate the
definitions. Each of the data items is accompanied by the information
that tells its size to the data packet generator. Additional
information that is critical for data packet generator is whether the
data item needs to move back and forth from the host to device and
vice versa or if it is strictly temporary – it needs to have
space on the device but never needs to move between devices. A parser
converts this information into json files that the code generators can
use to emit data for both data packet and task generation.</p>

<section id="runtime-elements">
<span id="sec-rtelements"></span><h2>Runtime Elements<a class="headerlink" href="#runtime-elements" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The primary runtime elements are the thread teams which are created on the
host when the simulation starts and persist throughout the application
execution.  The number of threads in each team is specified at the
time of execution.  To apply a computation to a set of blocks in an arbitrary order, a
thread team is assigned an associated taskfunction along with all
relevant data. items get enqueued with the thread team for
execution. Milhoja coordinates the asynchronous movement of data
to  the target memory systems
as well as execution of all associated tasks.
Note that taskfunctions can execute code
on any device without being aware of the specifics of the device so long as the
required data is resident in the appropriate memory system.</p>
