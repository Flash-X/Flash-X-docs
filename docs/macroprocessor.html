<p>With the advent of accelerators we need to have
many more alternative implementations to accommodate differences
in hardware characteristics. Combined with the already existing
alternatives, in many situations we would have had a combinatorial
explosion of maintained alternatives to continue to have the same level of
flexibility in application configurability on different
platforms. Often, the alternatives for
different devices need either a different data layout or a different
control flow while the arithmetic of the algorithm remains the
same. Hence, without some form of unification of the code base there
would be rampant duplication of arithmetic code leading to maintenance
difficulties. This is the primary challenge that C++ based tools
addresses through template meta-programming, which is not available in C or
Fortran. Another obvious solution is to use macros to encode the
invariant arithmetic code. We have taken this approach, but instead of
using pre-processor macros, we built a more capable and versatile
macroprocessor described below.</p>
<section id="using-macros">
<span id="sec-mpuse"></span><h2>Using Macros<a class="headerlink" href="#using-macros" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A function in a physics unit typically has some
arithmetic interspersed with some control flow logic. Often the
features of the implementation that need to be modified for
optimization are data layouts and control flow without changing the arithmetic.
We begin by casting a non-trivial function in the physics unit
of the code as a collection of code blocks. Some code blocks may be
declarations, some may implement the control logic, and some will
implement the numerics of the function. Sometimes arithmetic and logic
blocks cannot be separated out so some code blocks have both. These code
blocks become <strong>components</strong> in a hierarchical composability through the use
of macros in the form of key-value dictionary where values are code
snippets of arbitrary length and complexity. Keys, or macros are user-defined
with a provision for multiple alternative definitions, including null
definitions, which lets them mimic specializations similar to those
provided by C++ template meta-programming.</p>
<p>The macros supported in Flash-X are similar to C preprocessor
macros in how they are defined. They permit arguments, are allowed to
be inlined in a regular programming language statement,  and one macro name
can be embedded in another macro’s definition as long as self-reference
is avoided. Where are tool differs from the preprocessor is in
permitting alternative definitions, including null definitions for
macros, and an arbitration mechanism to select a specific definition.
The macroprocessor is written in python and the definitions are stored
in <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">``</span></a>.ini’’ files, according to the Python ConfigParser format. The
source files needing translation are given the extension <a href="#id3"><span class="problematic" id="id4">``</span></a>.F90-mc’’
to differentiate them from the source files that do not need
expansion.</p>
<p>Provision for alternative definitions combined with the ability to
embed a macro anywhere in the code permits arbitrary granularity in
code variants. The example shown below exhibits use of macros at
various granularities. In this example the CPU version of the code
uses 1D scratch arrays operating on one spatial data point at a time,
while the GPU version uses  4D scratch arrays operating on all spatial
data points simultaneously. Both versions otherwise have identical
logic for copying data into the target scratches. The macro <em>indices</em>
is the finest grain macro, with its null definition for the CPU
version allows unification of the scratch space reference in the
code. Similarly, macros <em>loop</em> and <em>loop_end</em> have null definitions
for the CPU version. Also, <em>hy_flux</em> is itself a macro which has other
other macros embedded in it. This approach can be particularly useful
when the involved arithmetic is complex but identical in both versions
and the only difference is in the data layout and access patterns.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>An additional feature is required if more than one variant needs
to be included in an application instance. It must be possible to
invoke each variant under different identifiers. For example, if a function
foo can generate two variants, var1 and var2, both of which need to be included
in the application,  then it must be possible to call them as
foo_var1 and foo_var2, but if they are exclusive in another
application instance then it should be possible to simply call
foo. Furthermore, with multiple alternative definitions existing for
macros, a mechanism is needed to arbitrate on which
variants are to be built with which definitions. The setup tool of
Flash-X already had arbitration built-in upto the granularity of
file. For macros arbitration is needed upto the level of a single
macro definition. The setup tool is enhance to keep track of macro
definitions in addition to files that it has encountered. The
inheritance rules remain the same as those for files, a local level
directory inherits all definitions and replaces those that are
present it any of its own “.ini” files. As with files, the definitions
placed in the Simulation directory of the application override all
definitions encountered earlier.</p>
<p>We have defined several macros for convenience that are available in
the file “macro_processors.ini” in the <em>bin</em> directory. The more
commonly used ones are described below.</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[loop_3d]</p>
<p>args=limits</p>
<dl class="simple">
<dt>definition =</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>do k=limits(LOW,KAXIS),limits(HIGH,KAXIS)</dt><dd><dl class="simple">
<dt>do j=limits(LOW,JAXIS),limits(HIGH,JAXIS)</dt><dd><p>do i=limits(LOW,IAXIS),limits(HIGH,IAXIS)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Use as &#64;M loop_3d(blkLimits)  results in the loop bounds for a triply
nested loop in place of the macro name where every occurence of
“limits” is replaced with “blkLimits”</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[bounds_3d]</p>
<p>args=limits</p>
<dl>
<dt>definition =</dt><dd><p>limits(LOW,IAXIS):limits(HIGH,IAXIS),&amp;</p>
<p>limits(LOW,JAXIS):limits(HIGH,JAXIS),&amp;</p>
<p>limits(LOW,KAXIS):limits(HIGH,KAXIS)</p>
<p>usage in declaration as</p>
<p>real, dimension(&#64;M bounds_3d(blkLimits)) :: arr</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>will result in a 3D array being declared with bounds defined using the
supplied two dimensional array blkLimits.</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[bounds_2d]</p>
<p>args=x1,x2,limits</p>
<p>definition =</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>limits(LOW,x1AXIS):limits(HIGH,x1AXIS),&amp;</p>
<p>limits(LOW,x2AXIS):limits(HIGH,x2AXIS)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>This macros is used for declaring 2D arrays when bounds are included
in the supplied array to replace <em>limits</em>. This one has an additional
feature, x1 and x2 can be “I”, “J”, or “K” to define which two
directions are included in the array</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[tileDesc_get]</p>
<p>args =lim1,lim2,lim3,del</p>
<p>definition =</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>lim1(:,:)=tileDesc%%limits</p>
<p>lim2(:,:)=tileDesc%%blkLimitsGC</p>
<p>lim3(:,:)=tileDesc%%grownLimits</p>
<p>call tileDesc%%deltas(del)</p>
<p>level=tileDesc%%level</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>&#64;M tileDesc_get(blkLimits,blkLimitsGC,grownLimits,deltas) fills the
supplied arrays with the corresponding tile data. It assumes that all
these variables have been declared in the code. The argument lim1 has
bounds for the interior cells of the block where the solution is to be
advanced and lim2 has bounds for all cells of the block including the
guardcells. The third argument lim3 is needed for tiling, that is if a
block is subdivided into tiles, the lim3 has bounds for the section of
the block that is the part of the tile and also includes those
interior cells that effectively become the guardcells for the cells
that are to be advanced in this tile. The final argument is a real 1D
array of size 3 in which deltax, deltay and delaz are returned. Note
that the function returns valid values for 1:NDIM dimensions
only. Also note that this macro fetches the value of the “level”
assuming that it has been declared as is in the declaration section of
the code. For convenience one
can use the next macro, “tileDesc_declare” in the declaration section
of the code to ensure that the variables are appropriately declared. Note
that the first three arguments given to the two macros must be
identical and identically ordered for correct behavior.</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[tileDesc_declare]</p>
<p>args = lim1,lim2,lim3</p>
<p>definition =</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>integer :: level</p>
<p>integer, dimension(LOW:HIGH,MDIM) :: lim1,lim2,lim3</p>
<p>real,dimension(MDIM) :: deltas</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>There are additional tile related macros that can be put in the “use”
and declaration sections of the code, as well as used as arguments. It
is not necessary to use any of these macros, however, users are
strongly encouraged to use them wherever needed. If we need to change
the tile class for any reason, it would be straightforward to make the
code compatible everywhere by just making the change to the macro
definition instead of writing scripts to do search and replace.</p>
<p>The next few macros pertain to the use of iterators in the code. As
with tiles there is one for the “use” section and one for the “declare”
section. For starting the iterator two different macros are provided;
one compatible with AMReX’s prefered mode of operating on a level by
level basis, and the other one compatible with Paramesh’s preference
of operating on all levels in the same loop. The arguments for the two</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[iter_all_begin]</p>
<p>args=x1,t1,lim1,lim2,del</p>
<p>definition =</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>call Grid_getTileIterator(itor, x1, tiling=t1)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>do while(itor%%isValid())</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>call itor%%currentTile(tileDesc)</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>&#64;M tileDesc_get(lim1,lim2,grownLimits,del)</p>
<p>call tileDesc%%getDataPtr(Uin, CENTER)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>This is the macro for Paramesh preferred iterators where x1 is the
argument for the blocktype (usually LEAF} and t1 is either .true. if
tiing is desired, and .false. if it is not. The arguments lim1 and
lim2 are the usual blkLimits and blkLimitsGC. Note that the macros is
assuming that grownLimits and Uin are declared as expected, they are
not among the arguments. The next macro has an additional argument l1,
where the value of level resides.</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[iter_level_begin]</p>
<p>args=x1,t1,l1,lim1,lim2,del</p>
<p>definition=</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>call Grid_getTileIterator(itor,x1,level=l1,tiling=t1)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>do while(itor%%isValid())</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>call itor%%currentTile(tileDesc)</p>
<p>&#64;M tileDesc_get(lim1,lim2,grownLimits,del)</p>
<p>call tileDesc%%getDataPtr(Uin, CENTER)</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
</div>
<p>The next macro is to be used at the end of the iterator loop. It
release the pointer Uin, and also the tile iterator.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>[iter_end]</p>
<dl>
<dt>definition =</dt><dd><p>call tileDesc%%releaseDataPtr(Uin,CENTER)</p>
<p>call itor%%next()</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>end do !!block loop</p>
<p>call Grid_releaseTileIterator(itor)</p>
</div>
