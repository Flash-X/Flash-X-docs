<p>The tool is the most important component of the . It implements the
inheritance and composability of the software system. It traverses the
Flash-X source tree starting from the directory hosting the specific
application definition. This starting directory is essentially the
selected implementation of the “Simulation” unit. While traversing the
source three the setup tool does the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>arbitrate on map from a key to its definition, in particular if
alternative definitions exist</p></li>
<li><p>arbitrate on which implementation of a function to use</p></li>
<li><p>link selected files (include source code and the key definitions) to
the directory</p></li>
<li><p>invoke macroprocessor to translate keys and generate source file</p></li>
<li><p>alter index order if desired</p></li>
<li><p>find the target</p></li>
<li><p>generate the that will build the Flash-X executable.</p></li>
<li><p>generate the files needed to add runtime parameters to a given
simulation.</p></li>
<li><p>generate the files needed to parse the runtime parameter file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>More description of how and the architecture interact may be found in .
Here we describe its usage.</p>
<p>The script determines site-dependent configuration information by
looking for a directory where is the hostname of the machine on which
Flash-X is running. <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id4" id="id1">1</a> Failing this, it looks in for a directory with
the same name as the output of the command. The site and operating
system type can be overridden with the and command-line options to the
command. Only one of these options can be used at one time. The
directory for each site and operating system type contains a makefile
fragment that sets command names, compiler flags, library paths, and any
replacement or additional source files needed to compile Flash-X for
that specific machine and machine type.</p>
<p>The script starts with the file of the specified application in the
Simulation unit, finds its units and then works its way through their
files. This process continues until all the dependencies are met and a
self-consistent set of units has been found. At the end of this
automatic generation, the file is created and placed in the directory,
where it can be edited if necessary. also creates the master makefile ()
and several  include files that are needed by the code in order to parse
the runtime parameters. After running , the user can create the Flash-X
executable by running in the directory. Note that the Flash-X build
system assumes that the command invokes GNU Make and is unlikely to work
properly with other implementations of the command. On some systems it
may be necessary to invoke GNU Make under the name .</p>

<h2>Setup Arguments<a class="headerlink" href="#setup-arguments" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>The setup script accepts a large number of command line arguments which
affect the simulation in various ways. These arguments are divided into
three categories:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><em>Setup Options</em> (example: ) begin with a dash and are built into the
setup script itself. Many of the most commonly used arguments are
setup options.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Setup Variables</em> (example: ) are defined by individual units. When

defined, see for more information.</p></li>

<span id="sec-setupshortcuts"></span><h2>Using Shortcuts<a class="headerlink" href="#using-shortcuts" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apart from the various setup options the script also allows you to use
shortcuts for frequently used combinations of options. For example,
instead of typing in</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>./setup -a Sod -with-unit=Grid/GridMain/UG</p>
</div>
<p>you can just type</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>./setup -a Sod +ug</p>
</div>
<p>The or any setup option starting with a ‘+’ is considered as a shortcut.
By default, setup looks at for a list of declared shortcuts. You can
also specify a “:” delimited list of files in the environment variable
and will read all the files specified (and ignore those which don’t
exist) for shortcut declarations. See for an example file.</p>
<div class="fcodeseg docutils container">
<p># comment line</p>
<p># each line is of the form # shortcut:arg1:arg2:…: # These
shortcuts can refer to each other.</p>
<p>default:–with-library=mpi:-unit=IO/IOMain:-gridinterpolation=monotonic</p>
<p># io choices noio:–without-unit=IO/IOMain: io:–with-unit=IO/IOMain:</p>
<p># Choice of Grid ug:-unit=Grid/GridMain/UG:

<p># frequently used geometries cube64:-nxb=64:-nyb=64:-nzb=64:</p>
</div>
<p>The shortcuts are replaced by their expansions in place, so options
which come after the shortcut override (or conflict with) options
implied by the shortcut. A shortcut can also refer to other shortcuts as
long as there are no cyclic references.</p>
<p>The “default” shortcut is special. always prepends to its command line
thus making equivalent to . Thus changing the default IO to
“hdf5/parallel”, is as simple as changing the definition of the
“default” shortcut.</p>

string-valued, integer-valued, or boolean. A call like</p>

can conditionally include and exclude parts of the file it reads based
on the values of these variables. For example, the file contains</p>
<div class="shrink docutils container">
<div class="fcodeseg docutils container">
<p>DEFAULT serial</p>
<p>USESETUPVARS parallelIO</p>
<p>IF parallelIO DEFAULT parallel ENDIF</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The code sets IO to its default value of “serial” and then resets it to
“parallel” if the setup variable “parallelIO” is True. The keyword in
the file instructs setup that the specified variables must be defined;
undefined variables will be set to the empty string.</p>
<p>Through judicious use of setup variables, the user can ensure that
specific implementations are included or the simulation is properly
configured. For example, the setup line expands to . The relevant part
of the file is given below:</p>
<div class="shrink docutils container">
<div class="fcodeseg docutils container">
<p># Requires use of the Grid SetupVariable USESETUPVARS Grid</p>
<p>DEFAULT paramesh</p>
<p>IF Grid==’UG’ DEFAULT UG ENDIF IF Grid==’PM2’ DEFAULT
paramesh/Paramesh2 ENDIF</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The file defaults to choosing . But when the setup variable Grid is set
to “UG” through the shortcut , the default implementation is set to
“UG”. The same technique is used to ensure that the right IO unit is
automatically included.</p>
<p>See for an exhaustive list of Setup Variables which are used in the
various Config files. For example the setup variable can be test to
ensure that a simulation is configured with the appropriate

<p>Information about unit dependencies, default sub-units, runtime
parameter definitions, library requirements, and physical variables,
etc. is contained in plain text files named in the different unit
directories. These are parsed by when configuring the source tree and
are used to create the code needed to register unit variables, to
implement the runtime parameters, to choose specific sub-units when only
a generic unit has been specified, to prevent mutually exclusive units
from being included together, and to flag problems when dependencies are
not resolved by some included unit. Some of the Config files contain
additional information about unit interrelationships. As mentioned
earlier, starts from the file in the Simulation directory of the problem
being built.</p>
<section id="configuration-file-syntax">
<span id="sec-configfilesyntax"></span><h3>Configuration file syntax<a class="headerlink" href="#configuration-file-syntax" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Configuration files come in two syntactic flavors: static text and
python. In static mode, configuration directives are listed as lines in
a plain text file. This mode is the most readable and intuitive of the
two, but it lacks flexibility. The python mode has been introduced to
circumvent this inflexibility by allowing the configuration file author
to specify the configuration directives as a function of the setup
variables with a python procedure. This allows the content of each
directive and the number of directives in total to be amenable to
general programming.</p>
<p>The rule the setup script uses for deciding which flavor of
configuration file it’s dealing with is simple. Python configuration
files have as their first line . If the first line does not match this
string, then static mode is assumed and each line of the file is
interpreted verbatim as a directive.</p>
<p>If python mode is triggered, then the entire file is considered as valid
python source code (as if it were a .py). From this python code, a
function of the form is located and executed to generate the
configuration directives as an array (or any iterable collection) of
strings. The sole argument to genLines is a dictionary that maps setup
variable names to their corresponding string values.</p>
<p>As an example, here is a configuration file in python mode that
registers runtime parameters named indexed_parameter_x where x ranges
from 1 to NP and NP is a setup line variable.</p>
<div class="fcodeseg docutils container">
<p>##python:genLines</p>
<p># We define genLines as a generator with the very friendly “yield”
syntax. # Alternatively, we could have genLines return an array of
strings or even # one huge multiline string. def genLines(setupvars):
# emit some directives that dont depend on any setup variables yield
“”” REQUIRES Driver REQUIRES physics/Hydro REQUIRES physics/Eos “”” #
read a setup variable value from the dictionary np =
int(setupvars(“NP”)) # must be converted from a string # loop from 0
to np-1 for x in xrange(np): yield “PARAMETER indexed_parameter_%d
REAL 0.” % (x+1)</p>
</div>
<p>When setting up a problem with NP=5 on the setup command line, the
following directives will be processed:</p>
<div class="fcodeseg docutils container">

As long as an implementation is included, the dependency will be

specify the appropriate implementations of the Particles subunits
to be used. The declaration should be accompanied by appropriate
“REQUESTS” or “REQUIRES” directives to specify the paths of the
appropriate subunit implementation directories to be included. For
clarity, our technique has been to include this information in the
simulation directory files only. All the currently available
mapping and initialization methods have a corresponding identifier

name, but the , and must correspond to existing identifiers defined
in . This is necessary to navigate the data structure that stores

possible to use the same methods for different particle types, but
each particle type name must only appear once. Finally, the

<p>The reason for this restriction is that is the maximum number of
array elements a mesh can be responsible for, and is the number of

<p>meshCopyCount = 3 numA = 11 numB = 15</p>

<span id="sec-hybridsetup"></span><h2>Setup a hybrid MPI+OpenMP Flash-X application<a class="headerlink" href="#setup-a-hybrid-mpi-openmp-flash-x-application" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There is the experimental inclusion of Flash-X multithreading with
OpenMP in the beta release. The units which have support for
multithreading are split hydrodynamics <a class="reference external" href="#Sec:PPM">[Sec:PPM]</a>, unsplit
hydrodynamics
<a class="reference external" href="#Sec:unsplithydroalgorithm">[Sec:unsplit hydro algorithm]</a>, Gamma
law and multigamma EOS <a class="reference external" href="#Sec:EosGammas">[Sec:Eos Gammas]</a>, Helmholtz
EOS <a class="reference external" href="#Sec:EosHelmholtz">[Sec:Eos Helmholtz]</a>, Multipole Poisson
solver (improved version (support for 2D cylindrical and 3D cartesian))
<a class="reference external" href="#Sec:GridSolversMultipoleImproved">[Sec:GridSolversMultipoleImproved]</a>
and energy deposition
<a class="reference external" href="#Sec:EnergyDeposition">[Sec:EnergyDeposition]</a>.</p>
<p>The Flash-X multithreading requires a MPI-2 installation built with
thread support (building with an MPI-1 installation or an MPI-2
installation without thread support is possible but strongly
discouraged). The Flash-X application requests the thread support level
to ensure that the MPI library is thread-safe and that any OpenMP thread
can call MPI functions safely. You should also make sure that your
compiler provides a version of OpenMP which is compliant with at least
the OpenMP 2.5 (200505) standard (older versions may also work but I
have not checked).</p>
<p>In order to make use of the multithreaded code you must setup your
application with one of the setup variables , or equal to , e.g.</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>./setup Sedov -auto threadBlockList=True ./setup Sedov -auto
threadBlockList=True +mpi1 (compatible with MPI-1 - unsafe!)</p>
</div>
<p>When you do this the setup script will insert instead of in the
generated Makefile. If it is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(1\)</span> the Makefile will
prepend an OpenMP variable to the , , variables.</p>
<div class="flashtip docutils container">
<p>In general you should not define , and in your . It is much better to
define , , , , , , , and in your . The setup script will then
initialize the , and variables in the Makefile appropriately for an
optimized, test or debug build.</p>
</div>
<p>The OpenMP variables should be defined in your and contain a compiler
flag to recognize OpenMP directives. In most cases it is sufficient to
define a single variable named , but you may encounter special
situations when you need to define , and . If you want to build Flash-X
with the GNU Fortran compiler and the GNU C compiler then your should
contain</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>OPENMP = -fopenmp</p>
</div>
<p>If you want to do something more complicated like build Flash-X with the
Lahey Fortran compiler and the GNU C compiler then your should contain</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>OPENMP_FORTRAN = –openmp -Kpureomp OPENMP_C = -fopenmp OPENMP_LINK =
–openmp -Kpureomp</p>
</div>
<p>When you run the hybrid Flash-X application it will print the level of
thread support provided by the MPI library and the number of OpenMP
threads in each parallel region</p>
<div class="codeseg docutils container">
<p>: Called MPI_Init_thread - requested level 2, given level 2
[Driver_initParallel]: Number of OpenMP threads in each parallel
region 4</p>
</div>
<p>Note that the Flash-X application will still run if the MPI library does
not provide the requested level of thread support, but will print a
warning message alerting you to an unsafe level of MPI thread support.
There is no guarantee that the program will work! I strongly recommend
that you stop using this Flash-X application - you should build a MPI-2
library with thread support and then rebuild Flash-X.</p>
<p>We record extra version and runtime information in the Flash-X log file
for a threaded application. Table <a class="reference external" href="#tab:flash_openmp_logs">1.4</a> shows
