The html source for what shows up in the User's guide is in the docs directory.
The souce to be edited is in `sphinx/source`. After completing edits one should 
run `make html` in `sphinx` directory to test if html source files are generated in correctly in
`sphinx/build/html`.

Deployment of the docs is managed through `make github` and is handled by automated github workflows
