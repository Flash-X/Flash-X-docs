The \unit{IncompNS} unit solves incompressible Navier-Stokes equations
in two or three spatial dimensions.
The currently released implementation assumes constant density throughout
the simulation domain.

Multistep and
  Runge-Kutta explicit projection schemes are used for time integration.
  These methods are described in Armfield \& Street 2002,
Yang \& Balaras 2006, and Vanella {\it et al.}\ 2010. 
Implementations using a staggered
grid arrangement are provided for both uniform grid (UG) and PARAMESH adaptive mesh
  refinement \unit{Grid} implementations. 
The \code{MultigridMC} and \code{BiPCGStab} Poisson solvers con be employed
  for AMR cases, whereas the homogeneous trigonometric solver + PFFT can
  be used in UG. Typical velocity boundary conditions for this problem
  are implemented.
