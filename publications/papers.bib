abstract = {Scientific software used on high-performance computing platforms is in a phase of transformation because of the combined increase in the heterogeneity and complexity of models and hardware platforms. Having separate implementations for different platforms can easily lead to combinatorial explosions; therefore, the computational science community has been looking for mechanisms to express code through abstractions that can be specialized for different platforms. Most existing approaches use template meta-programming in C++, and are, therefore language specific. We have developed a tool that uses customized expansion of macros to mimic some of C++ behaviour in other languages. It enables unification of any code variants that may be necessary to run efficiently on different target architectures and different computational environments through use of macros with multiple alternative definitions and ability to arbitrate on definition selection for expansion. Combined with two other tools, a custom runtime, and a user specified recipe translator, our custom macroprocessor becomes a part of an overall performance portability solution that does not depend on any specific programming language. We also use macros as code-shorthand that lets code snippets become building blocks that allow variations in control flow to explore performance options. We demonstrate use of macros in Flash-X, a multiphysics multicomponent code with many Fortran legacy components derived from an earlier community code FLASH.}

Having separate implementations for different platforms can easily lead to combinatorial explosion, therefore, computational science community has been looking for mechanisms to express code through abstractions that can be specialized for different platforms. Some approaches have met success through the use of template meta-programming in C++. However, their reliance upon C++ makes these approaches inaccessible to non C++ codes. In this paper, we describe a language agnostic methodology using macros that not only mimics the behavior of templates as applied in the abstractions, but also allows the use of code components as building blocks to explore implementation variants. We have successfully applied this methodology to Flash-X, a new multiphysics multicomponent code with many Fortran legacy components.",
